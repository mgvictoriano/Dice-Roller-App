## Overview
This Android app is a simple Dice Roller. When the user taps the "Jogar Dado" button, the app generates a random number between 1 and 6, simulating the roll of a six-sided die. The result is displayed both as a numeric score and as an image representing the rolled die.

## Features

- **Roll Dice Animation:** When the "Jogar Dado" (Roll Dice) button is clicked, the app generates a random number between 1 and 6, simulating a dice roll. The dice image rotates during the roll animation, and the resulting score is displayed.

## Usage

1. Launch the app on an Android device or emulator.
2. Press the "Jogar Dado" button to simulate rolling the dice.
3. Observe the animated rotation of the dice image and the displayed score.
